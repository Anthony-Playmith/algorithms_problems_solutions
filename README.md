# Data structures problem solutions

This repo contains data structures problems which I have been resolving over the time. The programming languages are Python and Java.

These algorithm problems have been gotten from different sources such as Udemy, Pluralsight, Books, Google, Leetcode and HackerRank. Anothers have been just created by my imagination.

Topics stack: Stacks, Queues, Lists, Hashes, Trees, LinkedLists, Binary Trees and more.

# Problems list

# 1. Given an array of integers, write a function to move all 0's to the end while maintaining the relative order of the other elements

Example 

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Expected output: [1,3,12,0,0]
